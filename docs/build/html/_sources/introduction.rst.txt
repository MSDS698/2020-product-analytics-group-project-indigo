Introduction
============

Our application is available at http://indigo-webserver.eba-mxse8mrw.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Google has an open-source project named Magenta that enables users to generate new music through machine learning models. We want to leverage this project to build a platform for artists and music enthusiasts to create a new form of music in ways that no other app allows them to.

Our web application will have a user interface that allows users to dictate the style of music they want to create by uploading their own music file. The app will then use the Magenta platform to output several slices of music in a similar style that the user can choose between.

It’s important to note we aren’t creating completely new songs. We are providing a tool for musicians to experiment with creating new layers/samples of music, augmenting their current creative process, not replacing it.

Another use case for this platform is a solo guitar player who wants to add drum beats to their music. Instead of having to learn drums or find a bandmate, they could input their music to our web app and have a drum beat for the song returned.
