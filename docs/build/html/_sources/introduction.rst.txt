Introduction
============

Our application is available at http://indigomusicstudio.com/

Inspired by Google's Magenta, we created Indigo.

We aim to provide a tool for musicians to create new music
and augment the creative process.

- We hope you enjoy Indigo and its many features. Here is what we currently offer to our users:
- Breakdown of tracks into its component instruments
- Generation of a drumline to add to user's existing tracks
- Interpolation between tracks
